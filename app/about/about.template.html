            <h2>About Edu-Bae</h2>
            <p>The rather poorly name Edu-Bae aims to tackle an issue with education that often goes unchallenged.
                Edu-Bae revolutionizes the way exams are conducted in order to better facilitate learning and measure
                understanding. By generating a unique test for each student based on their strengths and weaknesses,
                Edu-Bae leads to more effective, meaningful education.</p>
