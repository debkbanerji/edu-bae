                <h2>About Edu-Bae</h2>
                <p>The rather poorly named Edu-Bae aims to tackle an issue with education that often goes unchallenged.
                    Edu-Bae revolutionizes the way exams are conducted in order to better facilitate learning and measure
                    understanding. By generating a unique test for each student based on their strengths and weaknesses,
                    Edu-Bae leads to more effective, meaningful education.</p>
