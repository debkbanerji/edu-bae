# Edu-Bae
The rather poorly named Edu-Bae aims to tackle an issue with education that often goes unchallenged. Edu-Bae revolutionizes the way exams are conducted in order to better facilitate learning and measure understanding. By generating a unique test for each student based on their strengths and weaknesses, Edu-Bae leads to more effective, meaningful education.
